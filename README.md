# Curricular_Complexity_Project
- <p> This project is about EDA and comparative analysis on 15 majors at UCLA. The whole project was done in about 3 weeks and it was conducted by group of 5 people. </p>

- As a group of 5 people, we:

<p> - Conducted EDA and comparative analysis on 15 major curriculums in UCLA. These analyses use a variety of visualizations and provide in depth information on degree requirements. </p>

<p> - Used Excel and github repository to obtain the relevant data for 15 majors. </p>

<p> - Created variables that could be useful for insights on paths to degrees. ex) “number of hours to degree”, or “number of units to degree” </p>

<p> - Web scraped from MyUCLA(online UCLA registrar office) to extract major requirements and course requirements. </p>

<p> - Created curriculum mappings to visualize major complexity. </p>
